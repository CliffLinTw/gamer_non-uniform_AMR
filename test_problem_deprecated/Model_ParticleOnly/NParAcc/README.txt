   ** N particles force test **
   ****************************

Procedure to run the test problem:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Execute the script "Copy.sh" to copy files to their corresponding
   directories

2. Compile GAMER by typing "make" in the directory "GAMER/src"
   ("make clean" first if the program has been compiled previously)

3. Run GAMER by executing the file "Dizzy" in the directory "GAMER/bin/Run"


Note:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. This test randomly places N particles for a given density profile and
calculates the gravitational acceleration and errors

2. The gnuplot script 'plot.gpt' can be used to compare different results
