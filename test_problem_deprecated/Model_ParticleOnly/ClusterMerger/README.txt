   ** Cluster merger test **
   *************************

Procedure to run the test problem:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Execute the script "Copy.sh" to copy files to their corresponding
   directories

2. Compile GAMER by typing "make" in the directory "GAMER/src"
   ("make clean" first if the program has been compiled previously)

3. Run GAMER by executing the file "Dizzy" in the directory "GAMER/bin/run"


Note:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Test the evolution of (1) a single galaxy cluster in hydrostatic equilibrium
                         (2) two merging clusters

2. The simple gnuplot scripts 'plot_*.gpt' can be used for visualization
