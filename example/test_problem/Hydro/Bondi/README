Compilation flags:
========================================
Enable : MODEL=HYDRO, GRAVITY
Disable: COMOVING, PARTICLE


Default setup:
========================================
1. Units:
   (1) External (for Input__TestProb only):
       [L   ] = kpc
       [Dens] = g/cm^3
       [Mass] = Msun
       [Temp] = keV

   (2) Internal (for all other input files and internal usage):
       [L   ] = kpc
       [v   ] = 1e3 km/s
       [Dens] = 5.0e-25 g/cm^3
    -->[Time] = [L]/[v] ~ 0.978 Myr ~ 1.0 Myr
    -->[Mass] = [Dens]*[L]^3 ~ 7.4e6 Msun
2. Gravity dt is disabled by setting DT__GRAVITY to arbitrarily large
3. MIN_PRES = 1.0e-16


Note:
========================================
1. Dual-energy formalism is important for evolving pressure accurately in the
   high Mach number region (e.g., when Mach number is greater than ~10)
   --> Especially important for small GAMMA and large MAX_LEVEL
2. The gnuplot script "plot_diagonal.gpt" plots the simulation results along the diagonal
   and compare to the analytical solutions. The script "plot_profile.gpt" plots the
   shell-average profiles generated by "gamer_extract_profile".
3. By default it runs only for 10 Bondi time. One may need to run for a longer time in order
   to get the velocity field converge to the analytical solution at larger radii.
4. The contents of the file "Input__Flag_User" are not used actually
5. For large MAX_LEVEL (e.g., 11), using OPT__DT_LEVEL == 3 for the first step may result in
   unphysical results since the time-step would likely be over-estimated due to both the
   zero initial velocity and the disabling of DT__GRAVITY
   --> It's better to adopt OPT__DT_LEVEL == 2 and small DT__FLUID_INIT for the first step,
       dump data, and then restart with OPT__DT_LEVEL == 3
